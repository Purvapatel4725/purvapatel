I’m pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, Networking, and IT Security (Honors) at Ontario Tech University, and I’m ranked in the top 1% on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/ParadoxCanDoxX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TryHackMe</a>. My passion for penetration testing drives me to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance security measures. My journey began at age 12 when I started exploring and fixing vulnerabilities on my home network, which ignited my curiosity and solidified my expertise in cybersecurity. Alongside technology, I have a keen interest in business, geopolitics, and world history, which enriches my understanding of global trends and decision-making, providing a well-rounded approach to tackling both technical and strategic challenges.
